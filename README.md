# workspace

This repository is used to store some useful configuration files to hasten the
installation of a decent working environment.

## Setup

To setup the environment, run `setup.sh` and install the following packages
with your package manager (if they are available of course):

  * python3
  * ripgrep (for a faster grep utils)
  * teminator
  * vim-gtk (for gvim, better clipboard management and so on)

For debian eg, just run:

```
sudo apt install git python3 ripgrep terminator vim-gtk3 && ./setup.sh
``Ì€`

Then open vim, source the installed `~/.vim/vimrc` if not automatically done and
run `:PluginInstall`.
