  * ack (package `ack` or `perl-ack`)

  * if neovim is installed, add `source PATH_TO_VIMRC` in
    `$HOME/.config/nvim/init.vim`
  * in `~/.vim` install [Vundle][vundle]
  * in vim: source `vimrc` and run `PluginInstall`
  * install youcompleteme downloaded at previous step (read the README of the
    plugin!)
